Update 19.02:

1. I removed the class `section-title` and edit `index.css` to match the example from http://haus.ee.klient.veebimajutus.ee/
2. Fixed the arrow issue, I added the css that you suggested.
3. Fixed. Now `<header>` is the first element before `<div>`
4. Button is now responsive, removed `display: flex;`. I added `display: inline-block; max-width: 300px;` and padding.

I have updated the site to correspond to the example one, with `index.css` and `index.html`


Update 18.02:

1. Fixed `<a>` button element and added a global variable for the button borders
2. Fixed underline issue on mobile view for "Kureeritud kollektsioonid"
3. There was an issue where if the text paragraph was too long it would resize the images, now fixed.

Regarding the design: In the current version I made the subtext gray because I think it fits the website better.
