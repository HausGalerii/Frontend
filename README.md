Update 18.02:

- Fixed `<a>` button element and added a global variable for the button borders
- Fixed underline issue on mobile view for "Kureeritud kollektsioonid"
- There was an issue where if the text paragraph was too long it would resize the images, now fixed.

Regarding the design: In the current version I made the subtext gray because I think it fits the website better.
